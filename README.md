This is my python VR folder

I had the luck to work with Python this semester. My applications are to be used in a 
virtual reality experiment. I created classes to keep track of an individuals position
using motion capture and also to add elements to the environment that will serve
as obstacles for the experiment.

This is based on a paper I read this semester that discussed concepts that have to do with
perception. The paper was written by Fajen and Matthis of the RPI (NY). Their website can 
be found below:

I used the Vizard IDE for this project, which was quite useful to get acquainted with Python
and also had several tutorials on how to go through functions and featuers available on each
of its classes and libraries.
